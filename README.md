# Danger Signs of Pregnancy Predicting Model

This project uses *machine learning* to predict danger signs during pregnancy based on maternal health data.  
The model was built and trained using *Scikit-learn* in *Google Colab*.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview
- Developed and trained a *Logistic Regression* model to predict pregnancy risk categories.
- Performed *data preprocessing, **feature selection, and **model evaluation* using Scikit-learn metrics.
- Demonstrated how machine learning can support early identification of pregnancy risks.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Google Colab

## ðŸ“Š Results
The model effectively identified pregnancy danger signs and can assist in supporting preventive maternal healthcare decisions.
